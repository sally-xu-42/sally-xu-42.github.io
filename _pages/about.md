I am a second year PhD student at [Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/), a philanthropically endowed graduate institute for computer science, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). My main research interests are in natural language processing and computational linguistics, or anything about language really.

I am always happy to chat about research and possible collaboration opportunities (and also Jazz and J-Pop). Please feel free to reach me by [email](mailto:sallyxu@ttic.edu).
