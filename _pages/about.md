I am a second year PhD student at [Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago](https://www.ttic.edu/), a philanthropically endowed graduate institute for computer science, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Karen Livescu](https://home.ttic.edu/~klivescu/). My main research interests are in natural language processing and computational linguistics, or anything about language really.

To be more specific, right now I'm broadly exploring:
 
<ul>
    <li>Efficient small language models</li>
    <li>Spatial reasoning abilities of visually-conditioned language models</li>
    <li>Extra linguistic information in spoken language models</li>
</ul>

Before coming to Chicago, I spent 4 years at PolyU as an undergrad, and then 3 years at ETH Zurich working on word order typology, language acquisition and parsing algorithms.

I am always happy to chat about research and possible collaboration opportunities (and also Jazz and J-Pop), especially with researchers from underrepresented groups in academia. Please feel free to reach me by [email](mailto:sallyxu@ttic.edu).
