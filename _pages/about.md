I am a second year PhD student at Toyota Technological Institute of Chicago, a philanthropically endowed graduate institute for computer science, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. Karen Livescu. My main research interests are in natural language processing and computational linguistics, or anything about language really.

I am always happy to chat about research and possible collaboration opportunities (and also Jazz and J-Pop). Feel free to reach me by email.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
